## Recap

We have succesfully connected a fleet of simulated devices to a Mezmo Pipeline to clean, encrypt and route an important subset to S3 for later analysis.  You should have a Pipeline that looks like

## Next Steps

So we have the data encrypted and only the relevant events are in our S3.  But now what?

Check out our [S3 to Snowflake workshop](/mezmo-workshops/s3-to-snowflake/) to learn how to organize dynamically and get the transactions into a data warehouse for further analysis.  Or take a peak at our [Pet Clinic](/mezmo-workshops/pet-clinic/) workshop to utilize [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and find other ways you can take advantage of events holistically on the Mezmo Platform.
