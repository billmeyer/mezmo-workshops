## Overview

In this workshop, we will start by taking an existing Java Application (Spring PetClinic) and perform the following:

* Show the steps of how to download, compile, package and run the Spring PetClinic application
* Enable JSON-logging via configuration
* Stand up an OpenTelemetry Collector to collect the logs output by the application and send them to Mezmo Observability Cloud
* Configure an Observability Pipeline on Mezmo to filter out data we don't want to collect
* Define Alerts for conditions that we want notifications for.
