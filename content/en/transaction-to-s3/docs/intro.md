Before beginning, you will need the following

* A Mezmo account.  You can snag one for free here.
* Docker

## Overview

In this workshop, we will be managing signals coming in from many simulated edge devices.

To accomplish this we will

* Create a new Pipleline
* Configure an endpoint to receive the data (ie, a Source (LINK TO DOCS))
* Filter unneccesary events
* Encrypt PII in motion
* Store required data in S3
