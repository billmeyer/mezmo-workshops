  In this workshop, you will collect incoming financial transactions from edge devices, encrypt them in motion, filter, reduce and pass the information downstream to S3.  This is a common scenario in retail, banking and other industries with many complexities to consider.  A simplified version is presented to illustrate the fundamentals of the Mezmo Platform.
