## Recap

We have now succesfully connected a fleet of simulated devices to a Mezmo Pipeline and had data dynamically routed to an S3 bucket.  With data flowing, new files are created in S3 which are exposed by both an external table and ingested via snowpipe.  We are able to now write SQL on top of the data as shown in the image below.
