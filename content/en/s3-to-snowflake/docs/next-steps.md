## Recap

We have now succesfully connected a fleet of simulated devices to a Mezmo Pipeline and had data dynamically routed to an S3 bucket.  With data flowing, new files are created in S3 which are exposed by both an external table and ingested via snowpipe.  We are able to now write SQL on top of the data as shown in the image below.

## Next Steps

To experience more of what pipeline can do for you, take a peak at our [Mezmo Platform](/mezmo-workshops/pet-clinic/) workshop to utilize [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and find other ways you can take advantage of events holistically on the Mezmo Platform or feel free to explore our other workshops at [Mezmo Pipeline Workshops](/mezmo-workshops/).
