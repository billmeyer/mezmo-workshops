# Mezmo Workshops

## Accessing the website live

You can find the `main` branch hosted live at [logdna.github.io/mezmo-workshops/](https://logdna.github.io/mezmo-workshops/).

## Running the website locally

Building and running the site locally requires a recent `extended` version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
You can find out more about how to install Hugo for your environment in our
[Getting started](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/#prerequisites-and-installation) guide.

Once you've made your working copy of the site repo, from the repo root folder, run:

```
hugo server
```
